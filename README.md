# Fallacy

Fallacies are mistaken beliefs, especially one based on an unsound argument.

The conjunction is the mistaken belief that 2 conjunctions together are morer likely than either of the conjuncts.  For example, when asked to if more 7 letter words on a page end in "____ing" or in "_____n_", many will say that or think of more words containing "____ing" than "_____n_", despite "____ing" contining "_____n_".

The pacman game is simple idea.  When shown 2 fruits and having to go one side or the other based on background color and a light, what will they do when the light is covered.  Will they assume the light is on or that the light is off?
