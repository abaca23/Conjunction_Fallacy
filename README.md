# Background
This is the code used in a research project to give an inlook on the conjunction fallacy in humans using a pacman game.  (To know more information on this, look at the bottom of this README file.

### To run
To run this program, run

```
python3 first_code.py
```
this will pull up an window. Click 'again' to begin the proccess and 'q' to quit.

### Information about the project leading in
Fallacies are mistaken beliefs, especially one based on an unsound argument.

The conjunction is the mistaken belief that 2 conjunctions together are morer likely than either of the conjuncts.  For example, when asked to if more 7 letter words on a page end in "____ing" or in "_____n_", many will say that or think of more words containing "____ing" than "_____n_", despite "____ing" contining "_____n_".

The pacman game is simple idea.  When shown 2 fruits and having to go one side or the other based on background color and a light, what will they do when the light is covered.  Will they assume the light is on or that the light is off?
