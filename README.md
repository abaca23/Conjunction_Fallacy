# Background
This project is a look into the conjunction fallacy in humans.  More about the conjunctions fallacy can be found in the attached document, basics_of_conjuntion.tex. 

There are two versions of this code.  Conjunction_research.py is a program that can be used to look into the conjunction fallacy using a simple pacman game.  Endless_mode.py is for fun, where the goal is to get the highest score you can.

## To run Conjunction.research
The simple run:
```
python3 testing_mode.py
```
will create an output file called Conjenction_data.txt, where you will get data seperated by `-----`.  

The goal is to go to the correct fruit based on the light on the screen.  You can move the pacman using right and left arrows.  Hitting `q` will quit the program.  After 20 rounds there is no specific purpose and the program will record your reaction.

## To run Endless_mode.py
A simple run of 
```
python3 playing_mode.py
```
will create a text file called conjunct_score.txt.  It will only record the end score of the player then a new line.  Using the left and right arrows to move, your goal is to choose the right fruit based on the light on the top of the screen.
